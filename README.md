This resporitory contains my notes and projects implementations for the Coursera course "From Nand to Tetris" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken ([Official Website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)).

- [x] FromNand2Tetris Part 1: Hardware
- [x] FromNand2Tetris Part 2: Software
  - [ ] Project 9: High-Level Language
  - [ ] Project 12: Jack OS

All the software projects are implemented in C language with the corresponding Makefile. To compile the project, change the directory to the project folder `Project\xx` and run the following command:
```bash
make
```

Before compiling the project 12, `glib-2.0` library is required. To install the library, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
```
